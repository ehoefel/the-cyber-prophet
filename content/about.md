Hi, I'm the Cyber Prophet! Welcome to my website. I'm using it as a
communication channel with the _present_ time. Long story short, I'm from the
_future_. But if you are actually interested you can check out my posts.
Yeah, I write posts here. I guess this makes the website a sort of a blog? I'm not
sure. We have _memo sploinks_ in the future, but those are a bit different...

Well, it doesn't matter. What matters is that I'm done of the common world
(stupid 7-factor authentication!)
and there's nothing more to do there,
    so I decided to connect with the _present_ to see what's up here.

Now, with access to _the Internet_, I'm gonna spend quite some time checking
out books, games, and movies too.
I'll make sure to share here my thoughts on anything interesting I catch.

Of course, I'll also share a byte of what's going on in the _future_. I wouldn't
be the Cyber Prophet otherwise. But don't get too worked up: it's a shitty
timeline most of the time (It's so fucking hot in here!).

Anyway, if you got any questions or recommendations, you can reach out to me by
_email_. The address is in the home page. But watch out! I might _byte_ (I
    always wanted to say this).

Have a good time!

Warm regards,

CyP
