Hello cyber folks! I was planning on posting here last week, but my
pet-drone Dilik got sick, and I got quite busy figuring out how to use the RMT
(Robot Medical Toolbox). But everything is sorted out now.

Before delving into the topic of today's post, I'd like to give space to a
question I received from one of my readers:

> Hello, Cyber Prophet!\

> I wanted to know whether there will be more _Reeses_ in the future.

Dear _Redacted_,

No, there won't. But there might be some available in the _Nostalgic neighborhoods_ of the
_McVerse_.

Also, a quick check on _Wikipedia_ showed me that the company went bankrupt not long
after your passing. So your _lifetime supply_ is sort of granted, I guess.

Also, I have a feeling that those events might be correlated.

I hope that helps!!!

## Stories

Today, I want to talk about the importance of stories to humankind.
But for that, we'll need to go back to the origins of _storytelling_.

### The discovery of fire

It's fairly agreed that humans distinguished themselves from other animals
with the discovery of fire. After all, the flames served as protection from
predators; the heat fought the harsh temperatures during winter; and the flare
provided activity after sunset. In summary, the fire provided us the space to
develop ourselves beyond a survival-based lifestyle.

But I think there's another aspect of fire that is not much discussed:
it enabled _storytelling_.
As Anthropologist Polly Wiessner wrote:

> Night talk plays an important role in [...] transmitting the “big picture” of
> cultural institutions that generate regularity of behavior, cooperation, and

Basically, the big accomplishments of warriors and adventurers, when shared
around the campfire, would bring inspiration and lessons to the audience.
Those stories would later become songs and dances, shaping the culture and
binding members of the tribe.
Storytelling was responsible to conceptualize what we now know as _community_.
Check out their full study [here](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1404212111).

From there on, the powers of storytelling only grew, even influencing the
concept of _writing_ itself!
You see, when Homer came up with Iliad and Odyssey, the Greeks didn't have a
writing system as we currently know. Instead, they'd only use it to keep track
of transactions and costs, basically for taxes purposes.
But Homer's poems became so popular that people wanted to preserve them with
accuracy, which led to the concept of _a set of letters that represent sounds_,
the **alphabet**.

## The Origins of Fantasy

It's not difficult to see that communities centered around storytelling would
also have a role in the launch of mythologies.
All you need is to gather creative minds and let them contemplate the
mysteries around the world. Give them a few minutes and they'll say that there's
a guy out there rolling a boulder up a hill every day.
And people fully believed them, dictating a big part of their lives around those
stories.
Some would even call it [brainwashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity).

But we haven't talked about _fantastic_ narratives yet.
Indeed, besides the many questionable elements,
  the storytelling we discussed so far was meant to convince.
The idea of appreciating a story even though you know it's not true (which is
    what we know as _Fantasy_) was not popular at that time.
The first attempt at a _fantasy genre_ only happened with Lucian's _True Story_.

First, a bit of contextualization.
In 200 CE it was common for travelers to publish novels telling their adventures
on the far lands, and notoriety came to those who'd describe _fantastic_
encounters or discoveries.
With every novel, stakes would raise, and authors would write more and more
questionable reports.
This caught the attention of _Lucian of Samosata_, who decided to write a satiric
story so absurd that no one would ever believe in it, and name it _True Story_.

Yeah, no one believed in _True Story_, but some still appreciated the idea
behind it, which helped people accept that a story can be meaningful even if
it's a lie. And there you have it, the _Fantasy genre_ was born.

For me, the best part of _True Story_ is that the book ends abruptly;
the last paragraph promises that future adventures would be described in upcoming sequels,
which were never written.

I personally find it a genius move.

## The moral of the story

There's more to a story than the events it describes.

---

Last year I started to read _Dracula_.
No, I didn't finish it, but that's not the point.
The point is that I never felt interested in vampires, and yet I was reading the
most classical blood-sucker novel.
I remember that, throughout my reading, all I could think of was

_Wow, so this is the origin of Edward Cullen and all of those crappy
bastards_

I was fascinated to find _Dracula_'s description perfectly matching the way
he's portrayed in movies (or maybe it's the other way around).

I was captured by the process of imagining the scenes as they're described in
the book; because although they're not described as _antique_, or _vintage_, I
actively depicted them that way based on my knowledge of the context behind the
novel.

I was entangled in the wonders of how it felt to be reading this novel during
the time it was first published.

What I want to say is that, if _Dracula_ had been written **exactly as it was**
but by a different author, in a different place, at a different time, it would
have been a completely different story.
And that's what makes stories beautiful for me.
That the context around a story is part of its identity.
To fully appreciate a story we need to appreciate the author and the
process of writing it.
Or, as I like to say, to appreciate the _story behind a story_.

### A recommendation

I'd like to first thank you for getting this far in reading my monologue.
I hope it was somewhat understandable.
And if you feel inspired in any way by this, I have a book recommendation.

S, by Doug Dorst.

It is an _ergodic_ novel (a topic for another post) that tells the story of two
characters, Jen and Eric, as they go through the process of reading and investigating the book
_Ship of Theseus_ and its author _V. M. Straka_.
Now, the interesting aspect of this book is that Jen and Eric communicate via
side notes written on a copy of _Ship of Theseus_ that they borrow from the local
library.
And you, the reader, get to read exactly the copy of _Ship of Theseus_ that Jen
and Eric used to communicate.

That's it for today.
