Wow, I can't believe this actually worked!
I can now talk with people from the _present_ time!

You see, I'm from the future.
We're a few hundred years ahead in time.
Fun fact: for some stupid reason, your timeline is the reference _point 0_ in time,
    which is why we call it the _present_ time.

Damn, I'm so excited! I'd be telling all my friends right now, but I don't have
any. The ones I had got all stuck in the _McVerse_, just like everybody else.
I think I'm the only one on Earth that couldn't get in (stupid 7-factor
    authentication!).

So yeah, being stuck in the outside world by myself, I decided to set up a
faster-than-light network and try to connect with the _present_. The hardest
part was to buy the domain for the website. You see, most of the payment methods from the
present were long abandoned, including cryptocurrencies. So I had to buy an old
quantum-computer at a retail store to steal a random bitcoin wallet.

I hope it wasn't yours.

Anyway, that's how I ended up here.
Let me know if you have any questions, and
I'll try to answer them in the next post.

Have a good time!

Warm regards,

CyP
